# to test everything is OK on the API side and that specific RadioSim properties are OK (especially control that emulated received data is the one desired)

# Issue is that we need a connected device to perform all test so we will do as follows 
# => Try to scan for device. If detected then proceed to the test, otherwise drop the test 
# For UHD, we need to hardcode a potential IP address in case of non broadcast ehternet address. If we detect the UHD device with scan(:uhd) the we use the associated IP address. Otherwise we use UHD_ADDRESS. It means that in case of non broadcast ethernet link, you should modify the following line according to your UHD IP address
# --- USRP address 
global UHD_ADDRESS = "192.168.10.16"
#  This address may vary from time to time, not really sure how to handle dynamic testing
